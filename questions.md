sir please see built_in_fucs_ds.py and answer my questions:

- if i directly print list(zip(day,muscle)) it gives me output in list format, same goes for all iterators.
- but on line 13 I printed it as list first.
- then dictionary and the tuple.
- if i run this program it gives `data` as list format, after that it prints empty dict and tuple.
- but if i Comment line 13 and run it. then the output is `data` as dictionary and empty tuple.
- If do the same on for dictionary and list, it gives me `data` in tuple format.

1) Why is this happening?
2) Am i missing something?
